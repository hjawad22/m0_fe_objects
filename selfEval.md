# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
I struggled with the syntax, I didn't notice the the Object.keys and Objects.values had a capital O in it, so that was tripping me up.

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
I am taking notes in onenote because I am finding that it's working best for me because I get to categories my notes in the sections that we are covering. I find myself taking the best notes after I have came back to review the section. 

- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
I like to look at it first and see if I can scope out my mistakes, if I am really stuck then I turn to Google to get some answers.
